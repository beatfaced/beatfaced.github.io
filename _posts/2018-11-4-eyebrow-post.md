## Perfect Eyebrows

To have the perfect eyebrows, use a eyebrow pencil to mark down where you need to start your eyebrows, where the arch is supposed to be, and where the eyebrow needs to end. First, place the pencil at the top of the nostril  and mark it down once the tip of the pencil is next to the eyebrow. Next, on the side of your nostril, point the pencil up and mark it down to make the arch of the eyebrow. Lastly, at the bottom of the nostril, point the pencil upwards to mark the end of the eyebrow. Once you marked down where your eyebrows need to be, fill them in with the type of product you use and clean up with concealer.
